help.text=This step will advance a Cloud Manager Pipeline. The pipeline execution must be \
    in the context, via use of <code>acmStartPipeline</code> step or remote event. \
    <br /><br /> \
    If no actions are specified, it will advance the pipeline of whichever waiting state it is in. \
    If this is not desired, specify a particular build action. \
    <br /><br /> \
    If the pipeline is not in one of the configured actions, this step will fail. If a non-waiting action is configured, \
    this step will fail.
