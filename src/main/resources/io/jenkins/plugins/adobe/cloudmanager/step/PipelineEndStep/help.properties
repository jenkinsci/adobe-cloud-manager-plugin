help.text=This step will wait for an event from Adobe IO indicating that this pipeline has finished. \
  <br/><br/> \
  This step requires a block until <a href="https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-65646">this issue</a> is resolved. \
  <br/><br/> \
  <strong>Note:</strong> <i>Do not use this step with an empty block. If you do not provide any mechanism to pause the pipeline inside this step's block, and do not set <strong>emtpy</strong> to true, an infinite waiting loop will occur.<i>
