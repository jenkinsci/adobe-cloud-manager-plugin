help.text=This step will wait for an event from Adobe IO step events. \
    <br /><br /> \
    If the event is a simple occurrence of a step gate, it will be logged to the build console. \
    <br /><br /> \
    By default, any <i>waiting</i> event will pause the pipeline unless <strong>autoApprove</strong> is true. Advancing the pipeline requires uer interaction or a remote event. If <strong>waitingPause</strong> is set to true, then the pipeline will not pause. See the <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/adobe-cloud-manager-plugin/blob/master/doc/step/pipeline-step-state/README.md">GitHub documentation</a> for more details on use.
