help.text=Periodically checks whether or not a Cloud Manager pipeline execution has completed. The pipeline execution must be \
    in the context, via use of <code>acmStartPipeline</code> step or remote event. \
    Checks will be made every period as specified by the recurrence period property. \
    <br /><br /> \
    Default pause between checks is 5 minutes. A check will be made immediately upon this step's declaration in case the \
    execution has completed. \
    <br /><br /> \
    There is expiration limit for the checks, as long as the Cloud Manager API indicates that the execution has not ended, \
    this will continue to check its status. \
    <br /><br /> \
    Any errors that arise in underlying checks will immediately terminate this step.
